## Swapping Two Words
**Objective**: Write a Python script to take a string input consisting of exactly two words separated by a single space and print a new string with the words swapped.

### Instructions:
**Input Collection**
- The program will receive a single string containing exactly two words separated by a single space.
String Manipulation

**Swap the positions of the two words**
- Do not use any if-else statements or loops in your script.

**Output**
- Print the new string with the second word appearing first, followed by the first word.

**Example**
- For input "hello world", the output should be "world hello".

## Finding the Index of 'f'
**Objective**: Write a Python script to find the index of the first and last occurrence of the letter 'f' in a given string.

### Instructions:
**Input Collection**
- The program will receive a single string as input, which may or may not contain the letter 'f'.

**Index Search**
- Identify the index of the first occurrence of 'f' in the string.
- Identify the index of the last occurrence of 'f' in the string.
- If the letter 'f' occurs only once, print its index only once.
- If the letter 'f' does not occur at all, print -1.

**Output**
- Print the index of the first and last occurrence of 'f'. If 'f' occurs only once, print the index once. If 'f' is not found, print -1.

**Example**
- For input "coffee", the output should be 3 4.
- For input "fun", the output should be 0.
- For input "hello", the output should be -1.

## Removing Characters Between 'h'
**Objective**: Write a Python script to modify a given string by removing the first and last occurrence of the letter 'h', along with all characters between them.

### Instructions:
**Input Collection**
- The program will receive a single string in which the letter 'h' occurs at least twice.

**String Manipulation**
- Identify the first occurrence of the letter 'h'.
- Identify the last occurrence of the letter 'h'.
_ Remove both the first and last 'h', as well as all characters between them.

**Output**
- Print the resulting string after removing the specified characters.

**Example**
- For input "this is a high hill", the output should be "this is a ll".
- For input "happiness is hard to find", the output should be "ness is hard to find".

## Removing Characters Between 'h'
**Objective**: Write a Python script to modify a given string by removing the first and last occurrence of the letter 'h', along with all characters between them.

### Instructions:
**Input Collection**
- The program will receive a single string in which the letter 'h' occurs at least twice.

**String Manipulation**
- Identify the first occurrence of the letter 'h'.
- Identify the last occurrence of the letter 'h'.
- Remove both the first and last 'h', as well as all characters between them.

**Output**
- Print the resulting string after removing the specified characters.

**Example**
- For input "this is a high hill", the output should be "this is a ll".
- For input "happiness is hard to find", the output should be "ness is hard to find".
